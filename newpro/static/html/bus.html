Thiruninravur lake serves the neighbourhood for its water needs. It serves as the connecting hub between Chennai and Tirupati.The name Thiruninravur comes from the Tamil words Thiru, nindra and vur. The Tamil word Thiru represents the name for the Hindu god Perumal. Nindra refers to stood and vur refers to a village or a place. It is said that Lakshmi was travelling through the sky and saw this beautiful village and stood here; she wondered how beautiful is this village. Thus the place came to be known as Thiru-ninra-vur, the village where Lakshmi-Narayana stood. Here there are two ancient temples which are written in the history of Tamil literature. As moonlight comes on to the temple Gopura it is special for many occasions.
